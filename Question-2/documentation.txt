This script interacts with the JSONPlaceholder API to perform three tasks. Firstly, it retrieves the 200 most recent TODOs and prints them using the `pprint` function. Next, it creates a new TODO with specified data, prints the created TODO, and finally, it attempts to delete a TODO with ID 1, displaying success or failure based on the HTTP status code. The script utilizes the `requests` library for HTTP requests and `pprint` for well-formatted output.
