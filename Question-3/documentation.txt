This script defines a function, `generate_permutations`, that generates all unique permutations of a given string in alphabetical order. The script uses a backtracking algorithm to explore different character combinations. The `main` function provides sample input strings for testing, and the generated permutations are printed to the console. This script is designed to be part of a larger program, showcasing how to generate permutations without using the `itertools` library.
