# SQL Tables for Product Details Page Documentation

## Overview
This script sets up MySQL tables for a product detail page, inspired by the design on pvcfittingsonline.com's valves page (https://www.pvcfittingsonline.com/valves.html). The tables include MajorProducts, SubProducts, ProductDescriptions, and ProductImages. The script uses the `mysql2` library for database connectivity.

## Instructions to Run
1. **Install Node.js:**
   - Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from https://nodejs.org/.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the script directory.
   - Run the command:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
     This installs the required dependencies, including `mysql2/promise`.

3. **Configure Database Connection:**
   - Replace the database connection details in the script with your own in the `.env` file (DB_PASS, DB_USER, DB_HOST, DB_NAME).

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the command:
     ```
     nodemon config.js
     ```
     This will run the script, creating the tables and inserting test data.

## Notes
- Insertion script for test data is provided but commented out. Uncomment cautiously to avoid data duplication errors if the script is run multiple times.
- The script uses the `nodemon` package for automatic script restarts upon changes.

Feel free to customize the script and test data to suit your needs.
